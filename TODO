VIM:
  - Improve spell check colours
  - Improve diff colours
  - Git commit title should be brighter
    - Maybe use bold white for `Title` group
  - Maybe use a similar blue to the terminal variant
  - Update the README (show differences between paramount and photon)

EMACS:
  - Finish the GNU Emacs port (photon.el)

TERMINAL:
  - Publish the terminal colours
  - Switch to colours more similar to those used in the Vim theme (and try to
    use the 256 colour palette)
  - Tools I use the terminal theme for
    - Mintty
    - Termux
    - St

WEBSITE:
  Create a page on my website which can explain what it is, why it looks the
  way it does and give some background info.

  Provide the colours for the terminal version (and explain why it is more
  colourful than the editor variant).

  Link to both of the repository mirrors (Sourcehut and GitHub).
