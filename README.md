# Photon.vim

A minimal and elegant dark colour scheme for Vim.

![photon.vim](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim/raw/images/photon1.png)

Photon is a low-contrast colour scheme, which cares about the little details.
It is based on an old version of [paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount)
and is designed to look exactly the same on 256 colour terminals as it does on
true colour terminals.
